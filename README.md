# 🎄🎅🏻 Advent of Code
Hey, this is a repo to keep track of my advent of code solutions. I also post them to [my blog](https://mykal.codes/tags/advent-of-code/)

## Summary
Each folder in the main repo represents a year, and each folder within that represents a challenge for that specific day of advent of code. 
besdies that, there isn't a cohesive structure I stick to. 

I might try making one of the year's a "service" in the future. For example, each day is an API endpoint that you can send your data to via REST.

## Contributions
Nah these are *my* advent of code solutions! Make your own repo 😉
